## 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console ##
The goal of the project is to deploy on our server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.
We will implement only some features to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)

	* create your data model
	* manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
	* store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
